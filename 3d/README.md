3D Version
==========

This folder contains files specific to the 3D version of the project.

Guidelines:
- Develop 3D-specific assets and code here to keep the main site clean.
- Use the `feature/3d-version` branch for active 3D work.
- Open PRs into `main` (protected from direct pushes locally).

Getting Started:
- Start from `3d/index.html` as a scratch page for experiments.
- Add any 3D libs (e.g., Three.js) via CDN while prototyping; vendor locally later if needed.
